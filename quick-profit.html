            <h2>A Conventional Solution</h2>

            <div class="story-content">
                <p>You've secured a contract to build a freight hoist for a busy shipping warehouse. The design is straightforward—a wooden platform, hemp rope, a simple pulley system, and a hand-cranked winch. Nothing innovative, but it works and the pay is decent.</p>

                <p>The installation goes smoothly. Workers use it daily to move crates between floors. The warehouse owner is satisfied. You've earned $150—enough to cover two months of expenses.</p>

                <p>But three weeks after installation, you receive an urgent message. There's been an accident.</p>

                <p>You arrive at the warehouse to find a crowd gathered. The rope snapped while carrying a 400-pound load of iron tools. The platform crashed from the third floor. Fortunately, no one was on it, but a worker on the ground floor was struck by falling debris. He suffered a broken collarbone and severe lacerations.</p>

                <p>The warehouse owner is furious. "You built this! You said it was safe!" The injured worker's family is threatening legal action. Other clients who heard about your work are now hesitant to hire you.</p>

                <p>Standing in the warehouse, looking at the frayed rope end and the shattered platform, you realize the truth: you built exactly what was asked for, but you knew it wasn't safe. You had ideas for safety mechanisms but didn't implement them because they would cost more and take longer.</p>

                <div class="warning-box-content">
                    Between 1850-1853, dozens of fatal accidents occurred with rope-based freight hoists in New York alone. Hemp rope degrades from moisture, heat, friction, and load stress. Visual inspection cannot detect internal fiber damage. Most rope failures happened suddenly and without warning. The industrial norm was to accept these accidents as the cost of doing business.
