            <h2>Choosing Safety Over Profit</h2>

            <div class="story-content">
                <p>You call the developer and explain your decision. "We need three additional months to reinforce the cable system for a ten-story passenger application. The safety margins need to be absolutely certain."</p>

                <p>He's furious. "I'll lose money every day that building sits empty! I'll find another manufacturer."</p>

                <p>"Then do so," you reply calmly. "But I won't put my name on an installation that I'm not confident is safe. Not anymore."</p>

                <p>He hangs up. Your business manager looks pale. "That was our biggest contract. We needed that money."</p>

                <p>The next three months are difficult. You have to lay off some workers. Competitors circulate rumors that you're slow and difficult to work with. The developer indeed goes with another manufacturer.</p>

                <p>But then, eight months after the building opens, disaster strikes. The competitor's elevator cable fails during peak hours. The car drops three floors before the emergency brake engages. Fifteen passengers are injured, three critically. The developer faces enormous lawsuits.</p>

                <p>Within weeks, every major property owner in New York is calling you. They want the manufacturer who turns down work rather than compromise safety. Your order book fills with contracts from clients who understand that reliability matters more than speed.</p>

                <p>Your company becomes the gold standard. More expensive, slower to deliver, but absolutely trusted. Over the next decade, you install elevators in the most prestigious buildings in America—and not a single fatal accident occurs in any installation bearing your name.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="success-box-content">
                    Your decision demonstrates that maintaining standards, even when costly, builds lasting reputation and trust. The short-term loss of one contract led to long-term success built on uncompromising safety standards. Sometimes the best business decision is to walk away from business that compromises your values.
