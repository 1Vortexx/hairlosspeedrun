            <h2>The Pressure of Success</h2>

            <div class="story-content">
                <p>You delivered on schedule. The installation was completed professionally, and the building opened with great fanfare. Wealthy tenants moved into the luxury apartments. Your company received its largest payment to date.</p>

                <p>For seven months, everything worked smoothly. Then, during a crowded evening, the elevator carrying twelve passengers experienced a cable stress failure at the eighth floor. The safety brake engaged, but the sudden stop threw passengers violently. Three people suffered serious injuries—broken bones, concussions. One elderly tenant will never fully recover.</p>

                <p>Your engineer was right. The cable system needed reinforcement for this application. You knew this, but you delivered anyway to meet the deadline and secure the contract.</p>

                <p>The newspapers are merciless. "Otis Elevator Fails," reads one headline. "Profit Over Safety," declares another. Your company faces lawsuits. Worse, you face yourself in the mirror each morning, knowing you compromised on safety because of business pressure.</p>

                <p>Other clients begin canceling contracts. They don't want the manufacturer who cut corners on the prestigious Fifth Avenue building. Competitors use the incident in their marketing: "We take the time to do it right."</p>

                <p>You could fight the lawsuits and try to rebuild your reputation. Or you could take responsibility, make it right, and commit to never compromising again.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="warning-box-content">
                    This scenario illustrates a reality in engineering: external pressure to deliver faster and cheaper is constant, but the engineer's responsibility to safety never changes. When you compromise on safety to meet business demands, you personally own the consequences—regardless of who pressured you.
